    <head>Few Facts about lions</head>
    <h1>1. Nearly all wild lions live in Africa, but one small population exists elsewhere<hi>
        <p1>In the wild, there are two formally recognised lion subspecies. The African lion (Panthera leo leo) is found in Africa, south of the Sahara desert. The Asiatic lion (Panthera leo persica) exists in one small population around Gir Forest National Park in western India.Wild lions in the west and central Africa are more closely related to these Asiatic lions in India than to those found in southern and east Africa.<p1>
               
    <h1>2. Male lions can weigh 30 stone<hi>
                    
        <p1>On average, male lions weigh 190kg (almost 30 stone) and females weigh 126kg (almost 20 stone).
            They need this weight and power behind them to hunt large prey and defend their pride. <p1>
